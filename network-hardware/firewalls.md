### 9. What is a firewall, and what types are there?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Types of firewalls include:
- **Packet-filtering firewalls**: Analyze packets and block them based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, or protocols.
- **Stateful inspection firewalls**: Track the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.
- **Proxy firewalls**: Act as an intermediary between users and the internet, providing additional security by hiding the network structure.
- **Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)**: Include advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and application awareness.
