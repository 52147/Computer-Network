### 6. What is a router, and how is it different from a switch?
**Router**:
- Connects multiple networks and directs data packets between them.
- Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
- Uses IP addresses to determine the best path for data.

**Switch**:
- Connects devices within the same network.
- Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- Uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct device.
