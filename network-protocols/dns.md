### 3. Explain how DNS works.
DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. The process involves:
1. A user enters a domain name into their web browser.
2. The browser sends a request to the DNS resolver (usually provided by the user's ISP).
3. The DNS resolver queries a series of DNS servers to find the IP address associated with the domain name.
4. The resolver returns the IP address to the browser.
5. The browser uses the IP address to request the webpage from the appropriate server.
