### 7. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**:
- 32-bit address scheme allowing for 2^32 addresses.
- Written in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**:
- 128-bit address scheme allowing for 2^128 addresses.
- Written in hexadecimal and separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- Provides better security, address auto-configuration, and more efficient routing.
