### 2. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
- Connection-oriented protocol.
- Ensures data is delivered in the same order it was sent.
- Provides error checking and guarantees delivery.
- Slower than UDP due to its error-checking and acknowledgment mechanisms.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
- Connectionless protocol.
- No guarantee of delivery, order, or error-checking.
- Faster and more efficient for time-sensitive applications like video streaming or gaming.
